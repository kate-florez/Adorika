							<img src="img/woman.png"><br>Generation Z includes those energetic
							and young minds born after 1995. They
							have their own behaviors and a belief
							system marketers need to understand
							if they plan to target Gen Z.<br><br>
							It turns out Gen Z hardly believes in the
							concept called “The American Dream.”
							What they want is for marketers to
							shape messages that portray reality
							rather than the perfect lifestyle. Thus,
							marketers are advised to drop the
							notion of the ideal – be it beauty or
							anything else – and concentrate on
							something unique, something that has
							an entrepreneurial spirit.

						<h2 class="polygon_title">Generation-Z – what is it like?</h2>
						<p>
							The people of this generation are focused on real-time customer support, bringing solutions to any problem. Gen Z is an innovative and independent “technology friend” and is used to create its own ways and styles. The word “personalization” means a great deal to the Gen Z people. Marketers should keep this in mind when building their campaigns and design products and services that allow Gen Z to show its independence and strive for customization.

						<h2 class="polygon_title">Influence of devices around us</h2>
						<p>
							One of the differences between Millennials and Gen Z is that the latter is surrounded with computers and technology from birth. The world without technology seems alien to the Gen Z people. They live and breathe high tech and online, sharing everything they can find on the road. This means that marketers should not only be able to grasp the full essence of technology, but swim in the technological world like fish, creating an online open dialogue with this new generation.

							<p class="p_title_smart">
								Gen Z is quite flexible and receptive and includes a large portion of the population. Therefore, marketers who design their strategies with this generation in mind, improving their digital lifestyle, are bound to succeed amongst this dynamic, plus the innovative generation.
