						<p class="first-art">What if there was an ad format that could hypnotize your
							audiences? There is such a format – Cinemagraphs. If
							haven’t yet heard about them, then it’s time to fill the gaps
							since the industry is marching into the future and,
							according to Adweek, Facebook is anticipated to woo its
							audiences with Cinemagraphs.

					</div>
					<div class="article">
						<p>The secret behind Cinemagraphs is that they include both
							stillness and motion. Long story short, what you get in the
							end is a still picture with a small movement area inside.
							With the industry always moving forward, looking for new
							ways to reach audiences, there is no doubt that this new
							captivating GIF ad format will open up a lot of
							opportunities.

							We certainly very well remember the
							scene from the Harry Potter movie
							where he received the first ever
							photo of his parents. His emotions
							were overwhelming of course, and the
							fact his parents were moving in the
							photo made it seem reel. Apparently,
							some of the fans really wanted to
							bring the story into the real life. So,
							who came up with this gold idea? The
							credit goes to photographers Jamie
							Beck and Kevin Burg. They actually
							found that the audience response rate
							to these images is extremely high.
							Cinemagraphs are able to catch
							users’ eyes in seconds once they come
							to life. Some of the major brands are
							known already to be using
							Cinemagraphs as part of their
							marketing campaigns. Thanks to their
							creators, we can see the real
							revolution GIF formats went through.
							Regular GIF images have nothing to
							scream “WOW” about them. Their
							abilities are very narrow and their
							quality is also questionable.

							Cinemagraphs, on the other side, take a GIF image to a whole another level, increasing its popularity and making it possible to create a video autoplay, something that is expected to appear in social media newsfeeds more and more. They are anticipated to be used as a substitute to the videos we are so used to. In comparison to a usual video, it is easier to make users look at a Cinemagraph, rather than making them watch an entire video. How do you think Cinemagraphs will influence the advertising industry? Would you include them in your campaigns?
